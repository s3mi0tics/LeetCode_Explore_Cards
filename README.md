# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems and exercises in the [LeetCode Explore Cards]("https://leetcode.com/explore/"). My goal is to improve my foundational knowledge of data structures and algorithms by tackling problems from the Explore Card Track.

## Explore Card Track

[The Explore Card Track](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/the-leetcode-beginners-guide/679/sql-syntax/4358/) is designed to guide you when learning the fundamental data structures and algorighms that can be used to solve a wide variety problems. I will be using this track to help me study the following topics:

* Arrays 101
* Array and String
* Hash Table
* Queue and Stack
* Heap
* Binary search
* Linked List
* Recursion I
* Binary Tree
    * Trie
    * N-ary Tree
    * Binary Search Tree
* Recursion II
    * Dynamic Programming
    * Graph

I will be completing one card at a time, so stay tuned for more solutions!
